# Retail Authentication System – IT Consulting Proposal

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the IFN515 unit – Professional Skills for IT – and simulates a real-world consulting engagement with a small business client. Our team collaborated to understand client needs, propose a secure authentication system, and deliver a detailed solution plan considering ethical, technical, and business aspects.

## Problem Statement
The client, Rachel, manages a retail business and needed a secure, reliable login system for her staff. She was concerned about employee access control and usability. The task was to interview the client, identify her goals and constraints, and propose a viable authentication solution within her technical and financial limits.

## Solution Approach
- Conducted a detailed client interview to gather requirements.
- Proposed a tiered authentication system using usernames and passwords.
- Addressed usability, cost-efficiency, and future scalability.
- Developed a structured implementation timeline and risk mitigation plan.
- Reflected on legal, ethical, and professional responsibilities in IT consulting.

## Technologies Considered
- Authentication systems (web-based, cloud-based, and local)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data storage solutions (file-based, MySQL, cloud)

## My Role
- **Team project** with Alisa, Frederik, and Xiaofeng.
- I contributed to:
  - Leading client communication preparation
  - Drafting the proposed solution structure
  - Evaluating risks and mitigation strategies
  - Writing the professional reflection

## Challenges
- Translating non-technical client concerns into feasible technical options
- Balancing security needs with user-friendliness for a retail setting
- Working under tight word/page limits to deliver a professional report

## Learning Outcomes
- Practiced real-world communication with a mock client
- Gained consulting experience: requirement gathering, planning, and proposing
- Learned to consider ethical and legal concerns in designing IT systems
- Improved teamwork and project documentation skills

## Future Improvements
- Prototype a basic version of the proposed authentication system
- Expand solution scope to include inventory and transaction modules
- Simulate client feedback and iteration phase for enhanced realism
